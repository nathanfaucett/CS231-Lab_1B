you get knocked out
you go somewhere else
you find a dead man
you find a dead woman
you meet a buxom blonde
someone searched the place
you are not alone
you reach a dead end
a crooked cop warns you
you find a hidden door
you find a hidden safe
it starts to rain
you are arrested
you find a gun
you find a knife
you find a frayed rope
you find a vial of poison
you find a half-empty bottle of pills
you notice footprints on the carpet
the clock strikes midnight
a barking dog rapidly approaches
suddenly, a bullet whizzes past your ear!!!
you are almost run over
you are being followed
your flashlight suddenly goes out
you smell familiar perfume
you smell smoke
the telephone rings
there is a knock at the door
there is a sack of money on the floor
you hear footsteps behind you
you hear a gunshot
you hear a scream
you hear breaking glass
forget this story, it stinks!
